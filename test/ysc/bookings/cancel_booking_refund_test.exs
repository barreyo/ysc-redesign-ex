  Comprehensive tests for booking cancellation refund logic.

  These tests verify that:
  - Full refunds outside policy restrictions are processed immediately
  - Any refund subject to policy rules (partial, full via policy, or $0) requires admin approval
  - Both properties (Tahoe and Clear Lake) are handled correctly
  - Both booking modes (room and buyout) are handled correctly
