defmodule YscWeb.Workers.QuickbooksSyncExpenseReportBackupWorker do
  @moduledoc """
  Oban worker that runs periodically to find and export ExpenseReports that haven't been
  synced to QuickBooks yet.

  This worker:
  1. Finds all expense reports with status="submitted" and quickbooks_sync_status="pending" (or nil)
  2. Checks if there's already an Oban job enqueued for each report
  3. Enqueues sync jobs for any reports that don't have jobs already

  This ensures that any expense reports that failed to sync initially, or were created
  before the sync system was in place, will eventually be synced.

  Scheduled to run every 6 hours via Oban.Plugins.Cron.
