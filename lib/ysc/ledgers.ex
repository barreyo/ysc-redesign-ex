  Gets detailed imbalance information including which accounts are off.

  Returns:
  - `{:ok, :balanced}` if balanced
  - `{:error, {:imbalanced, difference, imbalanced_accounts}}` if imbalanced

  The `imbalanced_accounts` will include accounts that have unusual balances
  and could be the source of the imbalance.
